# BadassPascal
### This code came from my undergrad course project for compiler principles in 2015, although I did minimum bug fixes on this recently, this code still can not be considered as efficient nor even readible by any means because a lot of hacks were used to make it work and the writing doesn't confrom to a stable coding style either. However, it is something that I was proud of at that time.

Another PL/0 language (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/0) compiler and debugger written in C++.
